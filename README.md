# EfficientNet PyTorch
This repository contains an op-for-op PyTorch reimplementation of EfficientNet, the new convolutional neural network architecture from [EfficientNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946) ([TensorFlow implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/efficientnet)). 

This repository is being built at this very momement. When finished, it will include: 
 * Loading pre-trained EfficientNet models
 * Evaluating the models on ImageNet
 * Predicting on your own images with the models
 * Training new EfficientNet models

Check back very soon for the models!
